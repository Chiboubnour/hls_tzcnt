## TZCNT â€” Count the Number of Trailing Zero Bits

The TZCNT (Trailing Zero Count) instruction counts the number of trailing least significant zero bits in the source operand (second operand) and returns the result in the destination operand (first operand).

## Repository Content

This repository includes a C implementation (`tzcnt_u64_builtin`) and an optimized version for FPGA (`tzcnt_u64`) using Vitis HLS.
